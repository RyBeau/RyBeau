## Hi
#### I'm Ryan Beaumont, a 3rd Year Undergraduate Computer Science Student at the University of Canterbury. Here you'll find many of the projects I have completed during my time and university as well as a few I did for fun.

I’m currently working on my personal website. The Frontend is being build with Vuejs using bootstrap to style most elements initially so that I can be constructed quickly to test with the Backend. In terms of the backend I intend the site to allow people to create accounts and interact with blog posts on the site leaving likes and comments. Nodejs is being used to create the Backend API.

I’m currently learning Data and Network Security and AI in my University courses.
